YourFitnessPal is intended to be an app that helps you make healthy food choices.

We found this database/API that we intended to use: https://openfoodfacts.org/

However, the database dump provided is too large for a free MongoDB account. We ended up creating our own records - "Nutella", "Chicken Breast", "Medium-sized banana" (input manually).

Future features:

Profile page where you can add meals with whatever foods you ate to your profile. 
A way to give alternatives to unhealthy foods (as in, foods with bad nutrition scores).
More secure authentication.

The images folder has a component map and a layout of what we intended the search page to look like.
