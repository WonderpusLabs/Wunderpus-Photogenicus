YourFitnessPal is intended to be an app that helps you make healthy food choices.

We found this database/API that we intended to use: https://openfoodfacts.org/

However, the database dump provided is too large for a free MongoDB account and the API was difficult to use. We ended up creating our own records - only three - "Nutella", "Chicken Breast", "Medium-sized banana" (input manually).

We had a lot of setbacks with the database and back end which meant we were unable to implement our stretch goals and had to re-scope our MVP.

Our intention was that there would be a profile page and you could add meals with whatever foods you ate to your profile. 

We also hoped to implement a way to give alternatives to unhealthy foods (as in, foods with bad nutrition scores).

Our authentication allows you to sign in, but there is currently no way to prevent someone who's not signed in from accessing the search page.

The images folder has a component map and a layout of what we intended the search page to look like.
